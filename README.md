# generative-chatbot

For this project, our goal was to build a chatbot that can carry out multi-turn conversations, adapt to context, and handle a variety of topics.

We used a sample of the new Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus that consists of almost one million two-person conversations extracted from the Ubuntu chat logs, used to receive technical support for various Ubuntu-related problems. The conversations have an average of 8 turns each, with a minimum of 3 turns. All conversations are carried out in text form (not audio).
