301,1.tsv,2005-11-17T08:12:00.000Z,crimsun,stuNNed,a repo may not be specifically for your Ubuntu install

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:10:00.000Z,adub,,is it ok to add a repository that is intrepid to hardy?

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:11:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"you can use a backport, if there is one, or you can try compiling the *source* package of intrepid"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:11:00.000Z,LjL,adub,what is it?
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:12:00.000Z,adub,LjL,zoneminder 1.23.3
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:14:00.000Z,adub,LjL,do you have any recommendations
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:15:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"well you think wrong, backports is for installing *newer* apps. but anyway, there doesn't seem to be a backport for zoneminder."
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:20:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"if you wait a while i'll see if i can compile the intrepid version, then give you instructions to do it."

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:32:00.000Z,adub,LjL,your good i keep gettin
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:33:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list, and add this line:  deb-src http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted universe multiverse"

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:34:00.000Z,LjL,adub,top or bottom is the same
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:34:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"that's not a source package, that's just the upstream distribution. i'm talking about a *proper* Ubuntu source package, which will get a binary .deb compiled."
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:35:00.000Z,adub,LjL,ok ill follow your lead updating sources.list starting now
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:37:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"when you're done, create an empty directory with 'mkdir mypackage', then 'cd mypackage'"

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:39:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"then you'll have to modify a file slightly, because it doesn't compile out of the box. do 'cd zoneminder-1.23.3', then 'nano src/zm_mpeg.cpp'"

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:41:00.000Z,LjL,adub,uh?

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:45:00.000Z,adub,LjL,im sure you right lemme double check

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:50:00.000Z,LjL,adub,do you see 'url_fclose(ofc->pb);'?
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:50:00.000Z,LjL,adub,change it to:   url_fclose(&ofc->pb);

60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:53:00.000Z,adub,LjL,do you have a hardy build
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:53:00.000Z,LjL,adub,we don't want actual binary packages to be downloaded from intrepid repositories
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:53:00.000Z,adub,LjL,ok
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:53:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"yes, but you really shouldn't take binary packages from strangers. anyway, we're nearly done"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:54:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"but you would have installed it from the upstream source, which can be a bad idea"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:55:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"that would not have worked, build-dep gets the dependencies to *compile*, not the ones to run the *binary* .deb package"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:55:00.000Z,adub,LjL,thanks for helping i run that one command inside the zoneminder direcotry right
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:56:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"yes, 'dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc'. then if you 'cd ..', you should find a .deb package ready to be installed with gdebi or dpkg -i in that directory."
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:57:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"for your information, if there hadn't been this little difficulty with line 281, you'd just have done 'apt-get build-dep packagename ; apt-get --build source packagename', and you'd have found yourself with a working .deb immediately"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:57:00.000Z,LjL,adub,we had to complicate that a little because of having to edit the sourcecode
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:58:00.000Z,adub,LjL,ya im glad b/c the old version is buggy
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:59:00.000Z,LjL,adub,has it finished compiling? i need to go away soon
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T05:59:00.000Z,adub,LjL,it is still compiling this is on a somewhat slower box
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T06:01:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"you can just use gdebi to install it, that will get the dependencies too"
60,402.tsv,2008-12-02T06:04:00.000Z,LjL,adub,"uhm i'm sorry but i just have to go now, you may have to edit debian/zoneminder.substvars and change the dependencies..."

60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:30:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,so ima re-install it using wubi since i just uninstalled it
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:30:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,nope
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:30:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,i made the cd i mean but instead i just get a black screen
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:31:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,i hear some music like the bongos
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:31:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,after that im done
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:31:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,,"ok with the live cd u mean the three options demo installition , installtion, and more about ubuntu"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:32:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,use the person's nick that your talking to when responding so your message won't get lost in the noise.. just type the first few characters of the nick and hit TAB for easy completion.
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:32:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,you didn't use tab.. my nick got misspelled :) .. (that's a smiley face)
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:36:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,yes
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:37:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,"ok good i put the cd in and i get three otoptins which are demo and full installtion, install inside windows, and learn more"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:37:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,which 1 to chose?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:38:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,im still on my orignal Os windows ep
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:39:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,"you've obviously inserted the cd while still in windows.. do you want to keep windows on the computer and also have Ubuntu or would you like to wipe windows off and just have Ubuntu.. or still yet, do you want to just test Ubuntu out while in the windows environment?"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:39:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,"im just worried if ubunto doesnt work, then im screwed right?"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:40:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,in that case leave the cd in the drive and reboot the computer.. if the boot order goes to cd first then the live cd will boot and you can test the functionality of Ubuntu on your hardware.. being a live cd it won't touch the harddrive until you actually install.. it'll be much slower but functional.
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:41:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,if there are issues then with the live cd come back here and talk about them.. there might be answers to the issues.. when ready double click the install icon
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:42:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,ok
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:43:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,a loading screen with a organge bar going back and forth like a game of ping
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:43:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,that's good.. it might take a minute or two
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:45:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,"ok well a peachish background came up, the sound of bongos played, then the screen just went black"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:45:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,what kind of video card do you have.?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:45:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,before the backgroudn loaded it said something like timedout....
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:46:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,is this a newer computer?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:47:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,on reboot you had a menu that gave you the choice of windows or ubuntu.. did you install ubuntu already with wubi?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:48:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,"should i use wubi, get to login screen then go to terminal mode and put some commands in"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:48:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,uninstalled what?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:49:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,so wubi was first and you uninstalled that .. except now when you boot you still get a menu?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:49:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,"wubi i used first, installed that no icons on destop, uninstalled using wubi once again"
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:49:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,yes i sitll get a menu
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:50:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,with the black screen displaying can you click ctrl+alt+F3 and get a different black screen with a prompt?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:50:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,lemme try
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:52:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,when you reboot you might try to get into the bios of the machine and look at the boot order.. in fact on a dell you might be able to hit a key on boot to boot directly from the cd.. if there is that option reboot and choose that.. otherwise you'll have to look in the bios to rearrange the boot order of things so the cd is first and the harddrive is second.. then you should be able to boot dir
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:53:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,ok i will try
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:56:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,just to be certain whats the rite way to unstinall ubuntu to make sure i did it right?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:57:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,from wubi?  I've no idea.. never used wubi
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:58:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,so you have a black screen with a prompt
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T08:59:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,ah good.. yep
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:00:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,then it will buzz & wurr for a bit and leave you at the standard ubuntu desktop
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:02:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,is this the live cd or the alternate cd?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:02:00.000Z,ubuntunoo,izinucs,the livecd from which i burend using the iso image
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:03:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,click install ubuntu.. it won't .. it'll just take you to the live desktop..
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:06:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,??
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:08:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,that's a new one on me.. there is a wiki or something on dell's site for linux.. you might investigate there and search for your specific dell to see what issues people are having.. I suspect that there's a piece of hardware that's hanging everything up.. My new motherboard is like that.. took me two days to find an answer.
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:10:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,np.. sorry I can't be of more help
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:14:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,well if the live cd doesn't run the chances of it working without knowing what is currently wrong now is slim.. you have to solve that issue first.
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:14:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,really.. what's the answer?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:15:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,so the screen is working?  good .. just keep going and for space tell it to use the entire drive..
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:17:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,so he stopped you from installing or are you continuing?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:19:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,so you're running the live cd? or back to windows? or what?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:20:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,cool.. will your dad approve? or be pissed?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:22:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,full install takes less space than windows.. and it has all the programs you need typically.. then you can add tons more.
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:23:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,I take it this is your machine?
60,166.tsv,2008-11-30T09:24:00.000Z,izinucs,ubuntunoo,you in college yet?

60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:35:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,try to reinstall the kernel and update-grub
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:35:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,how do I re-install the kernel and update-grub?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:36:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,the problem may just be with your /boot/grub/menu.1st file on the system. But with out seeing the file its hard to tell.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:36:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,type in update-grub
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:36:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,I can tell you about my menu.lst
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:37:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,are you able to paste it?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:37:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"no, but I have information for it."
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:38:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,menu.lst. has the same root and kernel-'root=' setting for both the new and the old kernel
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:39:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,what exactly do you need to know about my menu.lst
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:40:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,does your menu.1st have initrd images listed under each kernel?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:40:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,and also what is the version of the kernel you are trying to boot 2.6.????
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:41:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,is this is? '/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=739367f4-5181-48ad-82c0-e7d028c6cf44 ro quiet splash'
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:42:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"I can log in throguh terminal using 2.6.20-15, I can get to graphical login, bot it hangs."
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:42:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,under that line should be something like initrd /boot/initrc.img-blah
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:42:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,is that there?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:42:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,alright log in to the machine in recovery mode and run update-grub
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:46:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,sorry I was at the other machine. The old kernel (that I can get up to the graphical lagin to) has this line: 'initrd:  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-15 generic'
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:47:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,okay. does the new one have a similary line just with the updated version numbers of 2.6.whatever
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:47:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,but the new kernel is missing that particual line. Should I still run the grub-update?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:47:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,yes. grub-update will try to recreate your menu.1st automatically is all.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:48:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,after grub-update is done check the menu.1st and you will need that initrd line for the new kernel. I'm just hoping it will add it for you.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:49:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"ok. so just run at terminal 'grub-update'. Once that is done, do you need the new kernel initrd or should it work?"
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:50:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,yes run 'update-grub' at a terminal. Like I explained it should add the initrd line you need. but you can check yourself after it is done.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:54:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"that didn't add the line... do I need to upgrade maybe? I tried using another kernel, I am going to see if that works."
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:56:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,I would try adding the line myself. Just copy one of the other ones the only thing that needs to change is the version number at the ends 2.6.etc....
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:57:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,ifyou look at one of the entries that has the line its pretty self explanitory.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:57:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,how do I add that like?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:57:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,edit the file with nano
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:58:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:58:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"thank you, and just add it?"
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:58:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,after you are done editing save the file by hitting ctrl+w
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:58:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,yeah just add it like the working kernels have.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T20:58:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,youc an back it up first to by sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst~
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:06:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"even after adding in the line, it says the file isn't found... Should I download the kernel again or..?"
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:09:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,what do you mean the file isn't found?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:12:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,I guess the kernel didn't download properly. Do I have to re-download it?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:12:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,did the error message change?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:14:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"there's no more 'problem syncing' or whatever message, but now it says that the file can't be found. I can still access the other kernel, but it still hangs at graphical login.."
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:14:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,sudo aptitude install initramfs-tools
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:14:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,then update-grub again.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:35:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,you would have to update your /etc/apt/sources.list and change all references to gutsy then do a dist-upgrade.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:36:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,crap really?? so that's even more things to take care of. Daaaamnnn :/
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:36:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,what do yOU mean?
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:37:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,Like I said it soundslike you are missing some packages particularly the inittramfs-tools
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:37:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,sry one t there.
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:37:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"well I figured that if I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 through the terminal, that might fix the problems :/"
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:38:00.000Z,Flyzoola,histo,"I tried getting the initramfs-tools, but it said I gotta disable something... and I don't know exactly what it is"
60,233.tsv,2008-10-23T21:39:00.000Z,histo,Flyzoola,well you need initramfs-tools to generate the missing file.

60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T16:55:00.000Z,krishna,phixxor,is model number = mac number ??
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T16:55:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,"no. mac number has to do with your network. your router should have the model number written on it somewhere, like nokia 1600 or something"

60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:09:00.000Z,krishna,phixxor,or is this step not needed ?
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:09:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,"it's recommened, but I'm not sure if it's actually needed. That's a very good question to ask this channel!"

60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:11:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,try checking with the commandline: open terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install -f' without the quotes

60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:14:00.000Z,krishna,phixxor,"but now, it says 380 mb to be updated... i enter your command and also entered autoremove command... but still update manager says 'fix broken first' but i have no broken in synaptic"
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:15:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,could you check something for me? 'less /etc/apt/sources.lst' and see if they say 'jaunty'
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:16:00.000Z,krishna,phixxor,hey. that command told 'no such file or directory'
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:16:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,sorry! it should be 'less /etc/apt/sources.list'
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:17:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,this is the file that tells apt-get what upgrades to download
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:19:00.000Z,krishna,phixxor,http://paste.ubuntu.com/305895/ here go

60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:20:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,which means it thinks it's upgrading already
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:21:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,try opening the file in nano and changing every instance of 'karmic' back to 'jaunty'
60,286.tsv,2009-10-31T17:21:00.000Z,phixxor,krishna,then run sudo apt-get update

60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:28:00.000Z,histo,cmp,As the guide recomends it could break your install.

60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:30:00.000Z,histo,cmp,well then I would wait untill the next version of ubuntu comes out and your problems will be solved.

60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:32:00.000Z,histo,cmp,That thread explains the issue and what you need to do to solve it. I've told you I would just wait untill the next version comes out to get the effects.
60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:33:00.000Z,histo,cmp,its not worth breaking your system over. especially if you don't understand they recomend not to do it.

60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:36:00.000Z,histo,cmp,then it should be working just as before.
60,118.tsv,2009-08-25T09:36:00.000Z,histo,cmp,hit alt+f2 and type in compiz --replace    then hit enter

60,424.tsv,2005-10-31T13:44:00.000Z,frank,PatrikJohansson,the reason you do this is because gcc-4 is the default compiler but the kernel and kernel modules need to be compiled with gcc-3.4 instead

60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T16:54:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,"then enter the password manually, and check 'Save password in keyring'"
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T16:54:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,hmmm
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T16:56:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,sudo restart network-manager
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T16:56:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,from the terminal
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T16:59:00.000Z,Diverdude,rigved,ok its cool.....its working now
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:00:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,so it worked after a restart
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:00:00.000Z,Diverdude,rigved,yeah
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:00:00.000Z,Diverdude,rigved,but there seems to be a problem...i cannot use normal network when on vpn
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:00:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,this is a bug that the connection does not get logged until restart
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:01:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,i do not know about that. i have never connected via a VPN before.
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:01:00.000Z,Diverdude,rigved,so if i restart computer i can use both vpn and normal network at same time?
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:02:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,no. i meant restart of network manager
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:03:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,: yes that could be it too (on the same network)
60,61.tsv,2010-11-11T17:05:00.000Z,rigved,Diverdude,i can only connect to one connection even when i have my wired as well as my wireless connected.
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:37:00.000Z,Gnea,,!modem | nicofs
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:38:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,I don't want to dial-up... I want an old-fashioned phone call...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:38:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"for phone calls, you'll need a phone."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:39:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"okay, the point of putting a simcard into a notebook is to get on the 'net with it, then you can use skype"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:39:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,But why? what specifications has a phone that my netbook hasn't?
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:39:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"your netbook is a computer, not a telephone. it's that simple."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:40:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,and why do smartphones what a netbook can do?
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:40:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"technically, my netbook has all you need for a phone call, just not the software..."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:41:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,have you ever seen a computer make a phone call like that before?
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:41:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,smartphones don't count.
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:41:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"How do you think, professional hotlies work?"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:41:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,that's different.
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:41:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,technically not.
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:42:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"uh, technically, yes. they're using voip."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:42:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,ok. fair point. but there is software to send SMS. why not phone?
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:43:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"my original question stands: have you ever seen or used a computer to make a telephone call, using a telephone line directly?"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:44:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,not as such. I did send and receive SMS so far. that's the same protocoll as a phone call. why shouldn't it work? an iPhone can surf and phone. I don't see why my netbook shouldn't... and (evil argument) in windows there is software for that...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:45:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"no offense, but how old are you?"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:45:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"22, studying informatics..."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:45:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"ok, but it is mobile phone functionallity..."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:46:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,then the probability that you've seen or used a standard telephone with an rj-11 connection is.... quite low.
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:46:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"SMS is for sending text messages, not voice calls."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T17:50:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"the bottom line is, it can't be done. why? because no one has done it. however, if you're electronically inclined and clever enough, you could likely patch something together in order to make it happen, but no, just because you put a simcard into a laptop doesn't turn it into a phone, it turns it into a cellular modem."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:09:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,that's a shame...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:12:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"well, considering the historical context of linux, I don't think there was ever any kind of need for it"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:15:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,all I found was asterisk... but that's far too professional... and I found some how-tos to do it via console like with minicom or wavemon... maybe I should research that...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:16:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"yeah, asterisk requires special hardware too, it won't count your sim as such"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:16:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,I really don't get how wavemon would have anything to do with it...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:17:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"as far as I unterstand it, making a phone call is possible with wavemon..."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:17:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,or maybe it was even minicom I read about...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:18:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"minicom can make a phone call, but unless you can somehow patch the speakers and mic into it, you're not going to get 2-way voice"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:19:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"sorry, I didn't mean wavemon but wvdial... my mistake"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:20:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"wvdial would have to be severely hacked to do that sort of thing, as it's geared toward a data-only connection"
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:21:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,well then I should look into minicom... I will not be defeated by my netbook...^^
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:22:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,that's the spirit! and I wouldn't give up on wvdial
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:23:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,as soon as my exams are done I will see to it... what would be a good programming language for a gui? I don't exactly like java - but at least I know it...
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:24:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,C is always good..
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:25:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,"ok, why not learn C over christmas..."
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:25:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,and gtk uses C
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:26:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,is there something like eclipse for C?
60,292.tsv,2010-11-25T18:26:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,eclipse can do that
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:16:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,have you tried installing wicd and using that in place of networkmanager?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:18:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,how can i install it without network...?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:18:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,ethernet
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:19:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,not existing...

60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:20:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,other pc^^
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:20:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,surely you have a method of copying files from that pc to the wifi one
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:22:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,can i tell synaptic to download the install file to a specific place and not install it?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:22:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,that question makes no sense without a proper point of origin
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:23:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"I'm not sure if synaptic can, but I know apt-get can"
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:24:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,can i specify the cpu architecture when downloading via apt?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:24:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,"no, it will default to the distro that's installed"
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:29:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,i installed wicd... how do i use it? do i need to stop network manager before?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:30:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,yes
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:31:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,then logout/login
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:31:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,how do i stop network manager?
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:32:00.000Z,Gnea,nicofs,remove it
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:51:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,wicd doesn't find the networks either...
60,292.tsv,2010-12-17T19:53:00.000Z,nicofs,Gnea,never mind... no time left... have to fall in line in 5 minutes...

60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:45:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,you need to manually try to mount it...
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:45:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,how do i do that?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:46:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,so put ntfs/dev/...?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:49:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,it didnt quite work

60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:51:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,the drive is still in the media folder but nothing on it is accessable.
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:52:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,a lot of stuff

60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:55:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,you need to run that command like so... sudo mount ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/DRV5_VOL1
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:55:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,did i not?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:56:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,same result
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:57:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,pastebin the listing fdisk -l
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:58:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49381/
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:59:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,so you have 2 ntfs drives....
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:59:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,"yes, one has windows on it, the other is for music and stuff"
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T09:59:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,i can no longer access my music and studd

60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:00:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen, so... if it is mounted... then try 'ls /media/DRV5_VOL1'
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:02:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,did nothing
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:02:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,so its not mounted...
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:02:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,well it is but it isnt
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:02:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,it was yesterday but its not today
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:03:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,it shows up in /media/ but i cant access it....many times
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:03:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,i can access it from windows fine so the drive is still in good shape
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:04:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,so lets try again.. sudo mount ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/DRV5_VOL1
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:04:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,same result
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:06:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,try 'sudo mount -a' just to let me see what it tries to do
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:06:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,it outputs 2 things that are not files
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:07:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49382/
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:08:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,hang on... just leave off the ntfs-3g part... and try sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/DRV5_VOL1
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:09:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,same output as -a
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:10:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,you mean /media/DRV5_VOL1?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:10:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,"yes, its in my filesystem already"
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:10:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,could it be a permissions thing?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:11:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,if you do a 'sudo ls -al /media/DRV5_VOL1' there is no higher ... so you'd be able to see files in it if it was mounted
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:11:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,its it says /media/DRV5_VOL1: not mounted
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:14:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,i would love to keep everything on it
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:17:00.000Z,nomasteryoda,Flughafen,then you can defrag and it should fix your error and let it mount easily like before
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:19:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,now how do i use it?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:19:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,is it a command line program?
60,250.tsv,2007-12-23T10:24:00.000Z,Flughafen,nomasteryoda,ill defrag it from my windows partition
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T04:54:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Try setting Sys>Prefs>Appearance>Visual Effects tab to Extra
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T04:57:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Set Sys>Prefs>Appearance>Visual Effects tab to Extra for it to start when you login
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:29:00.000Z,soreau,randal,What happens if you set System>Preferences>Appearance>Visual Effects tab to Extra?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:29:00.000Z,randal,soreau,It enables graphics and works perfect
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:30:00.000Z,soreau,randal,And when you restart is it still set on extra?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:32:00.000Z,randal,soreau,i dont understand why these dont start on boot if i go into startup applications and add these two programs they boot up fine
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:32:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Have you been running as root or run any programs with sudo?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:33:00.000Z,randal,soreau,sorry i dont understand your question
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:34:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Does 'ps ax|grep gnome|grep daemon' show any output?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:35:00.000Z,randal,soreau, do i type that in terminal and i am doing another fresh install its 96% done
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:35:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"If you're doing a clean install, why are you worried about your old problem?"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:36:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"My best guess is something in $HOME got messed up, either permissions or otherwise"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:36:00.000Z,randal,soreau,the first time i start a fresh install everything works fine its when i restart it it doesent boot properly
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:36:00.000Z,randal,soreau,how would something get messed up when its a fresh install absolutely nothing done to it
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:37:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"I have no idea. If it is in fact a clean install, no telling what's going on. File a bug report"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:38:00.000Z,randal,soreau, but the werid thing is many ple with the same laptop as me works fine for them
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:39:00.000Z,randal,soreau, could it be a download error with the iso that i put onto my usb
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:39:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"It could be anything really. bad memory, hard disc faulty. no telling what would cause such a strange issue for you"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:40:00.000Z,randal,soreau,ya its realy angervateing windows xp works fine tho so i dont think its a hardware problem
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:41:00.000Z,randal,soreau, where do i go to see the startup script
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:43:00.000Z,randal,soreau,ok i just figured something out i think with the fresh install i can restart it fine and it works properly but when i change to clasic mode(not nbr) it messes things up
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:43:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"I really don't know exactly how ubuntu has gnome configured to start everything. AFAIK, they launch a daemon that's supposed to take care of everything on startup"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:44:00.000Z,soreau,randal,What is nbr?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:44:00.000Z,randal,soreau,netbook remix
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:44:00.000Z,soreau,randal,That's probably your whole problem. You said it was a completely clean default install which it isn't with nbr
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:45:00.000Z,randal,soreau,its a clean nbr install
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:45:00.000Z,randal,soreau,nbr comes built in
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:45:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"That's not what you said at first. Anyway, that's most likely your problem"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:46:00.000Z,randal,soreau,sorry but im confused why this is not a clean install
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:46:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"I don't know anything about nbr, but it is your most likely culprit"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:47:00.000Z,randal,soreau,well thanks for your help ill try a couple things and if i cant get it to work i will install ubuntu without nbr
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:52:00.000Z,randal,soreau,so i think i might of found another thing as soon as i enable the graphics card this start to act up
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:54:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"Are you absolutely sure compiz isn't starting? If you try to click where the panel is supposed to be, does it show up?"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:54:00.000Z,randal,soreau, yes it is untill i restart the computer then compiz doesent start at all
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:55:00.000Z,randal,soreau,if i click where the panel is oposed to be it comes up but after i restart compiz doesent even start
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:56:00.000Z,randal,soreau,what i am thinking is nbr mode does not like graphics enable but when i am in clasic mode graphics works flawlessly
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:56:00.000Z,soreau,randal,I think you're probably not realizing it but compiz is starting and causing your panel to disappear at first
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:56:00.000Z,soreau,randal,What makes you think compiz isn't starting?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T06:58:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"Try this: Instead of typing compiz --replace, instead do 'ps ax|grep compiz' and pastebin the output to pastebin.com"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:00:00.000Z,randal,soreau,ok im still havent restarted since i did the fresh install it will take me a second i just put ubuntu tweak on the computer to see the start up and i dont see gnome-panel or compiz in it
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:02:00.000Z,randal,soreau,im just restarting
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:02:00.000Z,soreau,randal,gnome-panel is started by a daemon and compiz is started by gnome-appearance-properties which probably also has the gnome daemon start it for you so you're not going to see it in sessions
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:02:00.000Z,randal,soreau, im not in season im in auto start
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:03:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"session, auto start, startup programs whatever. they're all the same thing"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:05:00.000Z,randal,soreau,this is werid its not messing up give me a second
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:08:00.000Z,randal,soreau,this is the strangest thing its working now
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:08:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Good. leave it alone now
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:08:00.000Z,randal,soreau,ive installed ubuntu 4 times in a row and this is the first time it worked
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:08:00.000Z,soreau,randal,Where did you get that ubuntu tweak?
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:09:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"My motto is if it's not in the standard ubuntu repos, don't use it. If it was a good program, it would be in the repos"
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:09:00.000Z,randal,soreau,it looks rely good  its made from ubuntu  i think http://www.getdeb.net/release/4775
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:10:00.000Z,soreau,randal,It could be screwing you up
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:10:00.000Z,randal,soreau,this is the first install i used it
60,244.tsv,2009-09-19T07:10:00.000Z,soreau,randal,"Oh well, hopefully you don't break it again"

60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T15:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,you can copy one of the items from ~/.config/autostart    then edit the text to run whatever you want. You will need to use:  gksudo shutdown -h now        as the command ran.
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T15:06:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,"edit each line as you want, you can even customise the icon if you want"
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T15:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,mark it as executable
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:06:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,you can make the shutdown command not need a password
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:06:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,you can

60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,run:  sudo visudo
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,add the line: %sudo      ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,"then the users which can use sudo, can shutdown the PC without a password entry"
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:10:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,you'll still need sudo to be added to the comman
60,5.tsv,2012-11-29T16:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,media-centre,above the last line will do

60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T18:48:00.000Z,mazda01,Lartza_,because you would put the mech assult game in with the exploit plugged into a usb stick and that would boot an ftp server for you and you could fix it from there.

60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T18:51:00.000Z,mazda01,Lartza_,it won't. i just figured you want to back it up before you re-do the mod. you'll have to use xbhdmaker  or whatever it is to prepare your hard drive again and install xbmc on it again
60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T18:52:00.000Z,Lartza_,mazda01,There is xLinux!

60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T19:01:00.000Z,Lartza_,mazda01,It is a regular hard drive :)
60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T19:01:00.000Z,mazda01,Lartza_,"im talking about running the livecd from your computer, you'll haev to take the harddrive out of your xbox and put it in your computer"
60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T19:01:00.000Z,Lartza_,mazda01,Oh it is in my computer but isnt xebian for install to the hd?
60,129.tsv,2009-08-09T19:02:00.000Z,mazda01,Lartza_,"yeah, but it's a fatx filesystem which is a proprietary filesystem"

60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:10:00.000Z,pimplife,,on the live cd the resolution and on the alternate cd it gets stuck on resizing partions
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:12:00.000Z,pimplife,,like 20 mins
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:12:00.000Z,pimplife,,320gb
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:13:00.000Z,pimplife,,but i only choose 76.77gb
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:15:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"vista has it's own resize tool, use that to resize before installing"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:15:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,i did but on the alternate cd u can only choose the hdd not partions
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:16:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"hoo, use manul partitioning. You can get as precise about partitions as you like"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:17:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what u mean
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:17:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"when you use the alternate install disk, the very last option in the partitioning is 'manual' . Use that, you can assign partitions very precisely"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:45:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"about 512mb , unless you need to hibernate. Then the same as ram +100mb is recommended"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:46:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,some said twice ur memory is that true
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:47:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"that used to be the recommendation when machines had low memory, not so true now"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:49:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"choose one as ext3  and mounted at   /   , the other small one as swap"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:50:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,thanks but what about all the other options
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:50:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"you should also set the one you use as   /   for formatting, not use existing data."
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T21:51:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,thanks
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:05:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what do i do with boot flag option
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:06:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"for the ubuntu one, it doesn't matter."
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:06:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what lable option
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:06:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what about lable option
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:06:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,whatever label you might like. gutsy might work ;)
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:07:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what about mount option
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:08:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,now that's critical. The ext3 partition needs to be on   '   /   ' root partition
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:12:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife," when you click on mount point, it should give a list, like   /   /usr   /home  , choose   /"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:20:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,theirs also an option thats asks how much % to save or something like that
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:20:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"I don't recognize that, what does it say exactly?"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:34:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,it says reserved blocks 5%
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:35:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"ah, that's fine."
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:35:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,what about typical usage option
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:35:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,it says default
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:36:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,wait
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:36:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,so boot flag doesnt matter right
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:36:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,correct
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:46:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,the the thing says it will erase the data on my pation that i set to leave alone why
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:48:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,ubuntu says it will erase the data on my pation that i set to leave alone why
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:48:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,is it the swap? go back and check if that's the one it's talking about.
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:49:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,no its just the warning it says but im scared it will erase vista
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:50:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,what partition is your vista on?
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:52:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"well, you're putting ubuntu on some partition, and swap on another. Vista exists on a partition as well. All you have to do is make sure what partition it is, and that that partition is not set for formatting"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:53:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,ubuntu says it will only format the partions i choose but the warning it gives data will be lost on removed partions as well
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:54:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,I don't remember ever seeing the alternate saying that data on a disk I didn't set for formatting would lose data
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:54:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,s/disk/partition
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:55:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,oh hold on
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:56:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,i think it means that if i choose to delete a partion as well
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:56:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,but thats what it says tho
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:56:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,hm. Data loss is not a good thing:  'I think' is not something I want to base advice on
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:57:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,but only the 2 partions i choose showed up in the list to be formated so i think im good
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:58:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"that is good, yes."
60,222.tsv,2008-03-23T22:58:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,but I'd suggest going back and checking ....
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:18:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,try adding Option     'sw_cursor'  to the Device section of your xorg.conf
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:20:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,thats it nothing els
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:20:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,it's something you can try.   It goes with the video driver section.
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:21:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,with or with out quotes
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:22:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,with quotes around  'sw_cursor'
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:25:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,do i back up the file before changing it
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:25:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"but of course. Backup backup backup, backups are never a waste of time"
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:25:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,ill try it ill be back
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:43:00.000Z,pimplife,nikrud,before i use themes do i need to install anything
60,222.tsv,2008-03-24T01:43:00.000Z,nikrud,pimplife,"nope, all the theme mechanisms are already in place. The software cursor worked?"

60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:27:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,mm. is it an old bios?
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:29:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,no.
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:30:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,worked quite fine until today's upgrade
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:31:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,it's just the error you get
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:31:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,Error 18: Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS

60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:32:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,ah ok.
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:35:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,ok. sounds like you could be in real trouble if fsck can't fix it
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:36:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,"yeah, that's what I'm afraid of :("

60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:36:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,yeah
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:37:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,worse even is that I don't know should I install ubuntu anymore if it breaks again..
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:39:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,ubnutu doesn't break more than windows. less if anything. it's just bad luck
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:39:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,"however, always backup important stuff no matter the OS"
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:40:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,sure...

60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:43:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I'm sure it's not related to ubuntu. I could have happened with any distro/os
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:43:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,I had something like that with RH 6.0 years ago

60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:46:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I'm not sure. I use a custom vanilla kernel.
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:46:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I think you were just unlucky.
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:47:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I don't think it's because of a bad kernel
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:47:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,"well, the upgrade was not an upstream upgrade but a package upgrade, therefore I suspect it's not the vanilla kernel that caused this."
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:48:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,hopefully... well I'll investigate more tomorrow with the livecd
60,403.tsv,2006-01-09T13:48:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,"still, an upgrade hosing your fs? sounds like bad luck or an unstable disk to me"

60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:45:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,do you think it would be hard to hand compile it?
60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:45:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I'm thinking maybe I need it too

60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:46:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,didn't try but I guess with a 2.6.15 kernel seeing what you said
60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:46:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,"hand compiling is easy, but I want a deb so it gets into the package manager db not messing the system"

60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:50:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,I think I could manage to make a deb though
60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:50:00.000Z,visit0r,mwe,already doing it... nice to learn the process myself
60,403.tsv,2006-01-20T06:51:00.000Z,mwe,visit0r,yeah. I sometimes used checkinstall. then just ar x the deb and modify the version. makes it kinda easy

60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:31:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,can the modem be connected via ethernet?
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:34:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,what's your answer to my question :-)
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:35:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,"that's very very bad, look around what local linux users have to say about this. -- also buy linux supported hardware only :-)"
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:36:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,also look up the orig. maker of the modem for driver support
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:38:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,this happen's :-| again ask local linux users
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:39:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,remember few people in this channel will be from Eire or wherever you are :-)
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:40:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,try to figure out beforehand as much as possible.

60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:45:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,can you identify the device that they will give you?

60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T07:56:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,the first one you gave me (linksys) has ethernet ports and thus should be no problem. maybe the *setup* must be made from windows (due to isp shoving windows down your throat) but that can be circumvented in most cases. -- anyway you said it was going to be isdn?
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:00:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,"ah i see. anyway for any dsl router/modem you buy, just make sure it has at least one ethernet port and not *only* wireless/usb connection to the computer. then you'll be fine, mostly. of course you'll need an ethernet card."
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:04:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,"not always, some big isp's make that in windows program only. ask isp beforehand. -- anyway the funniest thing: i think the linsys has linux running inside as an operating system. you'll then have two linux boxes"
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:05:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,have to leave soon -- any other questions about this?
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:07:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,"ubuntu/linux surely won't hinder that. some big isp's sell you customized routers/modems with their service where they could break that. as i said, if you buy this from your isp, ask them. if you buy from hardware shop, it should be ok"
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:10:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,enter http://192.168.1.1/doc/index.htm(l) or something similar in address field of the browser. the documentation of the modem will surrely have this
60,359.tsv,2006-09-11T08:10:00.000Z,nozorro,Paddy_EIRE,look up the documentation for the device beforehand at the maker's site

60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:56:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,which services in my pc will be disabled if unselect that option?
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:56:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,the mDNS services
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:57:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,is it important
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:57:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,"if you use UPNP/ mDNS , it's important to you i guess. if not, then no"
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:58:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,i dont have much idea about these things thats why i am asking
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T11:59:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,do you use any UPNP services?
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:00:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,"for example, i think i use a pen drive is it UPNP device"

60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:02:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,very few people use the UPNP features
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:02:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,any example so i can know what are those UPNP services
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:03:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,local chat servers on your lan
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:03:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,just disable it!!!
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:03:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,well i am not using any of those here
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:04:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,is there any equivalent of NBTrio like in windows
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:04:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,what's nbtrio?
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:06:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,"NBTrio is a protocol in windows for file sharing in LAN , names resolution protocol, is there any equivalent in linux?"
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:07:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran, 'Automatic service discovery' is the Ubuntu equivalent :)
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:08:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,so if i disable this service then i wont be able to browse LAN
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:08:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,"you WILL be able to browse your lan, because it uses ANOTHER technology"
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:08:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,since for browsing LAN the OS needs to resovle names into IP address
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:09:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,like in windows if i disable NetBios
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:09:00.000Z,magnetron,vsayikiran,you could use the System > administration > shared folders utility
60,269.tsv,2007-09-27T12:10:00.000Z,vsayikiran,magnetron,then to access somebodys pc i have to type IP address and not smb;//computername

60,65.tsv,2011-05-13T09:25:00.000Z,tntc,cordoval,just 'umount /dev/sdc1'
60,65.tsv,2011-05-13T09:28:00.000Z,tntc,cordoval,why aren't you just mounting the host disk from the liveCD and copying the folder directly? why bother with the chroot?
60,65.tsv,2011-05-13T09:28:00.000Z,cordoval,tntc,ask ActionParsnip: he was the one that started all this mess

60,65.tsv,2011-05-13T09:31:00.000Z,tntc,cordoval,"I hate to say it, but that doesn't require a chroot."
60,65.tsv,2011-05-13T09:32:00.000Z,tntc,cordoval,via the command line

60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:17:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"I have never used this program before, try just restarting the GUI ( x ) by pressing ctrl+alt+backspace"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:19:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Did it work?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:19:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,I am shocked
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:20:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Is that a yes?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:21:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,It worked although I must admit that in win my display was much nicer. I suppose this is the best I can see in ubuntu
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:22:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,You should be able to get the exact same resolution in linux as you get in windows
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:39:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"Ok, that means that you probably still arent getting your full resolution"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,What kind of display do you have?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Go into System -> Preferences -> Font
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,choose subpixel smoothing
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,If that doesn't look better try the other font rendering options
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:29:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,in subpixel smoothing there are 4 options under details that I do not understand. should effect be immediate or I need to refresh something?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:29:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,it should be imediate
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:29:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,"shubpixel order, what is that?"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"It is the order of the red green and blue pixels on the screen that make up one color pixel, it has to do with antiailiasing, basically just choose the one that looks best"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:35:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,I even have pixels of other colors around my black letters
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:36:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Do you have 'hinting' set to full?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:36:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,where is that option?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:37:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,yes I do
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"Sorry, click 'details to see more options"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:37:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,yes I have full
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:38:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,"I think it is not font problem. For example, round corners of my windows look like mices have bitten them"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:41:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,The only reason I can think of for you not getting full resolution is that your video memory is set too low in the BIOS ( windows simply ignores this setting which is why you have full resolution in windows )
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:41:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,so what should I try to set in BIOS?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"The amount of memory used for the graphics card, you want more"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:43:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,so I think i have 128M I should put that then?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:44:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"when you go into the BIOS menu it should have 2 or 3 options, choose the highest"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:44:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,"ok I am restarting now, see you later!"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:55:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,I didn't find the option! There is just a report page where it says that my video memory is 8 MB and that settings on that page can not be changed
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:56:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"Ok, do you know what resolution you get in windows?"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T07:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"Ok, please do to confirm weather or not it is a resolution problem"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:08:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,now I know what is the problem
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:09:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,are you here?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Yes
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,What is the problem?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:11:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U," I entered windows and it looked the same but I have naked system without special driver for that card and I remember that after installing that driver last time, the resolution and display completly changed"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:12:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,You have all the drivers you need right now in linux.
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,Did you get your display problems fixed?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:32:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,"not yet, I am downloading the driver for windows and when I install the right one there and check the settings I will return here"
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:42:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,I think I found something but I am not sure
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:44:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,are you talking about in windows now or in Ubuntu?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,You could try ##windows
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T09:50:00.000Z,steel_lady,Jordan_U,are you still here?
60,327.tsv,2007-01-13T09:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,steel_lady,"Yea, I'm back"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-22T05:15:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I was told ext3 don't need to be defragmented
60,249.tsv,2008-01-22T05:23:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"oh come on, Totem?!?"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-22T05:23:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I use VLC manly
60,249.tsv,2008-01-22T05:24:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"yeah, me too...but Totem gives me all kinds of problems"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:39:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,why are you compiling from source?
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:39:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,yea
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:39:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,I was asking why
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:39:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,yea I am compiling from surce
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:40:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,source**
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:40:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,'why'
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:40:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I need it for a program
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:40:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,that requires SDL 1.2.0
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:42:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,the version in repos is 1.2
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:42:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,no need to compile from source
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:42:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,apt-get install libsdl1.2debian
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:43:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,well I have that already
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:44:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"then you probably need some other SDL libraries, but compiling from source isn't the answer"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:44:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"SDL has a lot of diffeerent libs for sound, graphics, perl/python integration, etc"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:45:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,well I never had a problem with it
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:46:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"compiling from source is just going to cause you problems, and be more difficult than necessary"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:46:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,well compiling from source isn't recomended but sometimes it's necessary
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:46:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,what library in particular does this game need?
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:47:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,are you installing the game from a package?  what game? etc
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:48:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,for your info I am compiling zsnes because the one in the repos is much older
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:48:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"if you're compiling it, you need the -dev packages for SDL"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:50:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,ok but I can't seam to find libsdl1.2-dev says it has no install package
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:50:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,apt-cache search libsdl | grep dev

60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:53:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,you sure you typed it correctly?  works fine over here
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:53:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I have it according to ubuntu
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:54:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,but I get an error from the configure script
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:54:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,let me get it
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:56:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,heres what I get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53928/
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:57:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,you don't have the dev package for sdl installed
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:57:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,according to ubuntu it is
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:57:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,try reinstalling then
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:57:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,ok
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:58:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"actually, it's because it's looking in /usr/local instead of /usr, probably"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T06:58:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,run ./configure --help and set the prefix for SDL to be /usr instead of /usr/local
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:02:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,got the same error
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:03:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,is it still looking in /usr/local?
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:05:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,it's looking in /usr
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:05:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,try 'which sdl-config'

60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:08:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I believe I got it from the repos
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:08:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,then it would be in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:08:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,then I got them from sorce
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:09:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,source and packages don't work well together
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:09:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,run sdl-config --version
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:10:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,but if I yank the libsdl1.2-dev out alot of my packages well stop working
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:10:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,1.2.13
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:11:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"you probably installed part of SDL from source, and another part from repos, and it's confusing the heck out of the configure script"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:11:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,"spend some time finding everything, then use ./configure --help to figure out how to tell it where everything is"
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:17:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,it probly would be easier to just to reinstall ubuntu then trying to reinstall all of the packages I need to get all of my programs working again
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:17:00.000Z,nemilar,Shadow147,your programs will work fine without the -dev
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:18:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,some of the programs I compiled from source because there was no ubuntu release
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:19:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,or the one in the repos were older and probly woudn't
60,249.tsv,2008-01-29T07:33:00.000Z,Shadow147,nemilar,I have no choice I am just going to dump linux and reinstall it

60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:14:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"I can't mount the partitions, as it sees the MBR as being corrupt"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:14:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,but I can see the drives in fdisk now
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:15:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,what partition is your ubuntu install on
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:15:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"If I only knew... I'm going to assume it was either 1, 2, 3, or 6"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:16:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"Vista was 0,0 and XP was 0,4 --- not sure what else"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:16:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,2 is probably extended...
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:18:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,I did learn just now that I can boot grub from a CD..but that's going to be my last resort
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:18:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,Any other ideas?
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:18:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,I would try and mount your ext3
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:19:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,I can't --- the MBR won't allow for it
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:19:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,How did you try to mount it
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:19:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,e.g. it says 'Partition 4 does not end on cylinder boundary.' -- it doesn't even see them as existing
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:20:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,They've got starts and ends of sector 1
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:20:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,Apparently more of a feature than a problem..in normal conditions
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:20:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,My mistake was hiding the GRUB partition I assume
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:21:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,NOt sure how to undo that ..  let me know when you figure it out
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:22:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"I'm pretty certain at this point that I may be able to resolve this with a bootable GRUB disc, but I'm running low on them..so it's a bummer. Haha."
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:31:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,Great news
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:31:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,I realized I could run those commands directly from the grub shell on the livecd
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:31:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"I ran 'unhide (hd0,1)' etc from sudo grub on the livecd"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:39:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"Silly question for you, but what's a command to discern hd0,0 from hd0,1? fdisk -l seems insufficient, unless I just count manually"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:40:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,Not sure what you are asking
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:40:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,Just any means of determining a partitions number
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:40:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,So I can be sure my GRUB is configured right this time arond
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:41:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,hd0.0 = sda1       i dont understand
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:41:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"Ok, that's all I needed to know"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:41:00.000Z,SGBX7,Jack_Sparrow,"So /dev/sda7 is equal to hd0,7"
60,200.tsv,2008-06-22T16:42:00.000Z,Jack_Sparrow,SGBX7,"hdx,y   x is drive 0 = a 1 = b      y is partition  0 = 1   1 = 2"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:28:00.000Z,ryanpg,,hi all... I'm getting ready to setup ubuntu as a samba file server for about 30 OSX machines... any howto's around I could look at?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:28:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"OSX uses NFS, not samba"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:29:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,osx has samba support
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:29:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"NFS is native to OSX, samba is not"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:29:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,ok... what are you suggesting?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:30:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,use NFS with your OSX machines. samba for windows machines
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:31:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,"well performance isn't a big issue, ease of setup and 'hands free' maintanence is a priority... isn't samba a better fit?"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:31:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,why are you not using apples proprietary protocols?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:31:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,nfs is many years ahead of samba in those things
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:31:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,because my server is a linux box
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:32:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,then use NFS. it is stable and proven in enterprise environments
60,467.tsv,2005-10-08T10:35:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,it's not any more diffecult than samba
60,467.tsv,2005-10-21T16:03:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,in a terminal type 'apt-file search bleh'
60,467.tsv,2005-10-21T16:04:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,thanks... but now what package provides apt-file :P
60,467.tsv,2005-10-21T16:04:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,'apt-get install apt-file'
60,467.tsv,2005-10-21T16:04:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,gracias
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:17:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,the channel was locked down and nobody who was unidentified could speak
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:41:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"adding dapper may take you to the 'broken edge', heh"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:42:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,sure sure... so is there an in-between where I can get somewhat stable but fresh?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:42:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,only if you roll your own
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,ubuntu releases every 6 months
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,actually that's another thing that attracted me to ubuntu... it seems easy to creat debs from source via alien or checkinstall
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:44:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"checkinstall is ok for personal use, but dont get in a habit of converting rpms"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:44:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,checkinstall installs from source and creates a deb
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:45:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,i use it all the time :)
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:46:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,sorry I didn't understand what you were saying about converting rpms
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:46:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"there really is no need for alien, since the repos have 99% of what's in the debian library"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:46:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,but I'm the kind of tinkerer that needs CVS most of the time
60,467.tsv,2005-10-25T07:51:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"you start putting dapper things into your box, and you might fall over the 'just works' line"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:46:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"when dapper spools up, there will be backports aplenty"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:46:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,hi again :)
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:46:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"oh, btw, theres nothing keeping you from rolling your own"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:47:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,yeah I'm studying alien for this purpose (as I've been told checkinstall is 'unsafe')
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:47:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,alien is even more unsafe
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:47:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,really? can you elaborate?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:47:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"if you're gonna do it, use dpkg-buildpackage or its relatives"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:48:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,ok I'll google and man that... its funny how I'm gathering such contradictory advice :P
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:48:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"alien is for use with pkgs 'alien' to ubuntu. if debian binaries (ubuntus closest relative) are dangerous to use, what do you think using a redcrap pkg is gonna do?"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:48:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,oh no I wouldn't do that
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:49:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,"I'd install to a /temp directory, tar up that install then use alien to convert .tgz to .deb"
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:49:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,checkinstall makes debs that do not conform to debian standards (so they arent any good for passing around0
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:49:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,see my above post to you
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:50:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,huh? I agree about not using redhat or other packages... but using alien to simply package apps built from source is bad?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:50:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"if you're gonna do that, use dpkg-buildpackage or the other dpkg building tools"

60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:51:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,ok then I'm off to research dpkg-buildpackage
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:51:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToBuildDebianPackagesFromScratch.
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:51:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,no the .tgz I'm thinking of is the one I'd create from my own source tree and temp install directory
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:52:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,yer goin around the world with that idea to get next door
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:52:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,reading that link now
60,467.tsv,2005-10-26T05:52:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,also the 'new maintainers guide' at debian.org
60,467.tsv,2005-10-30T06:43:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,just ask your question
60,467.tsv,2005-10-30T06:43:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,ok... where's the 'dapper repository'?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-30T06:44:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,what is that?
60,467.tsv,2005-10-30T06:44:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,heh it's where unstable development debs make their first appearences ;)
60,467.tsv,2005-10-30T06:45:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,i wouldnt advise dapper for a few months
60,467.tsv,2005-12-22T07:31:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,a simple 'sudo apt-get install mplayer-686' will take care of all that
60,467.tsv,2005-12-22T07:32:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,yeah I just hate it when on package pulls in six other packages... including xmms for pete's sake
60,467.tsv,2005-12-22T07:32:00.000Z,nalioth,ryanpg,"beats having to chase each depend down by hand, right?"
60,467.tsv,2005-12-22T07:33:00.000Z,ryanpg,nalioth,err... I guess... it's really apples and oranges

60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:09:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,what was yer question?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:10:00.000Z,jud,wesguin, how do i set permissions so i can open pdfs on an external drive?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:10:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,the file or filesystem permissions?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:11:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,everything i think?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:11:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,seems to me that shouldn't be an issue
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:11:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,you  getting some error?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:12:00.000Z,wesguin,,it should only require read perms
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:12:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,"yeah, permission denied error when i try to save to the external drive or after i move a file to it i get the permission denied error trying to open it"
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:13:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,hmm.. what's the fstab entry look like?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:13:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,"...oh man, i'm new at this, what is that?"
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:14:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,I'm having a hard time rememberig myself.. but it's something to do with the mtab or fstab entries in /etc they govern the filesystem perms when it mounts
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:15:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,but my knowledge is really dated.. I used linux many years but stopped for awhile and now everything has changed a bit
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:15:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,now this external drive is that connected usb?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:16:00.000Z,jud,wesguin," ok....it wasn't happening before updating but then i did something just before updating that could have messed with it....yeah, usb connection"
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:17:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,well it's probably something to do with the automounting setup
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:17:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,hang on
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:17:00.000Z,jud,wesguin, ok
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:18:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,what filesystem is on that drive?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:19:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,"hmm, it may have been formatted on windows?"
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:21:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,can you open a terminal and check some things?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:22:00.000Z,jud,wesguin, yep
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:23:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,first run fdisk -l and find where it is.. like maybe it'll be /dev/sdc1 or something
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:24:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,you might need to put sudo before that
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:24:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,"ok, just getting familiar with the command line.  i can just past that command in as is or is there more to it?"
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:25:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,type: sudo fdisk -l

60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:27:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,one of those is your external drive
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:27:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,that is if it's plugged in :)
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:29:00.000Z,jud,wesguin,yep it's plugged in ok so i think i know which one it is...now what?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:29:00.000Z,wesguin,jud,which is it?
60,75.tsv,2010-05-17T18:29:00.000Z,wesguin,,it's probably the one at the bottom

60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:14:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"Well, first off one would have to try to figure out what you would pastebin. And since you're refering to the network-manager-applet as 'the little thing near the clock' we'll need to get the basics straight first."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:15:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,we dont need to go all the way to basics
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:16:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,You've used linux for three years and you still don't know what the network manager applet is called? o.0

60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:17:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,Well I'm glad that degree of yours is coming handy. :)
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:17:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,it worked igabit just before the last kernel bump
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:18:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"Well, that would have been helpful to know before I started to figure out how to debut the cabling and other interfaces. Have you tried downgrading the kernel="
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:19:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,i tried booting a livecd of 8.10 desktop (the system is now on server)
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:19:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,on the livecd i got about 12MB/s
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:20:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"So then it's a kernel configuration issue. I assume you're able to roll your own kernel after 3 years of linux and a uni degree, right?"
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:20:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,not sure :)
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:21:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"I see. Well, then the best advice I can give you is to bugreport the kernel issue and downgrade to the previous kernel package unless there are updates in there that you really, really need."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:21:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"It should not be, but since it's closed source one can never be sure."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:22:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,But since that driver is only a module for the kernel it should not affect other parts of it.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:22:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,would you say those Marvel drivers are easly broken?
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:23:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,Never had a marvel card so I would not know. I also have to little knowledge of the overall implimentation of the module code to know how robust it is against broken modules.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,those marvel cards are very common onboard cards
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,Just out of curiousity: Did you configure the network card in /etc/network/interfaces ?
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,"no, but i woudl actually feel more comfortable with that then with the 'little thingy near the clock'  :)"
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:26:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,Well if the driver supports it you could attempt to force it to 1G instead of 100M (or even 10M if that's what it's running)

60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:33:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,But that post is from '07 and does not explain the downgrade from the latest kernel update.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:34:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,Then you may want to check your cabling tbh. Especially if the router indicates it doesn't run at 1G. (Did it indicate that when running from the live cd?)
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:36:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"I see. Well, then everything points to the drivers in the kernel."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:37:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,would that be something that is resolved at some point or should i just get a PCI-E NIC?
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:40:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"Well, if you report the regression as a bug then it ought to be fixed. And unless there are any important security fixes in the latest kernel and no new features you really need then it should be no harm in downgrading."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:40:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"That said, using tried and tested hardware is never a bad idea."
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:41:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,according to http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/page-236334_38_0.html other people have experienced issues with that nic in linux.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:41:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,which hardware would be 'tried and tested' ?
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:42:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,I've never had any trouble with RealTek gb nics. Have got no experience with Intel nics.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:43:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,I guess looking at different products and comparing how many people complain would be a good indicator.
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:43:00.000Z,moonwatcher,BlueEagle,i had bad expriece with realtek :)
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:43:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,gigabit or the older nics?
60,392.tsv,2009-02-08T05:44:00.000Z,BlueEagle,moonwatcher,"Well then I guess NICs just don't like you much. :p Anyways, that's all the advice I've got for you. :/"

60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:20:00.000Z,fabio_,Cotowar,post a screenshot around
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:20:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"1 sec, ill photobooth my desktop with arrows to what im talking about"

60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:31:00.000Z,Cotowar,,what do you need?
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:31:00.000Z,fabio_,Cotowar,it's the same for me
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:32:00.000Z,Cotowar,,i wont accept that answer. there HAS to be a way to change it. otherwise we are slaves to the system like Windows users
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:32:00.000Z,Cotowar,,except we are goonier and cooler
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:33:00.000Z,Cotowar,,i want my firefox window to use the same icon as the applications menu shows
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:33:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"my window uses default, but my apps menu uses a custom"
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:34:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"yea, i have one, but how do i install it them"
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:34:00.000Z,Cotowar,,then*
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:34:00.000Z,fabio_,Cotowar,find that icon
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:35:00.000Z,Cotowar,,i know where its at
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:35:00.000Z,Cotowar,,and i did that to install the theme
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:35:00.000Z,Cotowar,,but all my apps still use defaults when they open
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:35:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"i have this archive, i dropped into theme manager and boom all my desktop icons went to the custom set"
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:35:00.000Z,fabio_,Cotowar,i think the trouble is /usr/share/pixmaps
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:36:00.000Z,Cotowar,,ill look
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:36:00.000Z,fabio_,,you have to change that link
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:36:00.000Z,Cotowar,,alright
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:36:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"ill look at gnome look some more, and in the pixmaps"
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:36:00.000Z,fabio_,,just make it point to the new icon set location
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:37:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"fabio, you are right"
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:37:00.000Z,Cotowar,,thank you sir
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:37:00.000Z,fabio_,,it's a little bug indeed
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:37:00.000Z,Cotowar,,do i change them simply by deleting the photo and copying my new one in?
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:37:00.000Z,fabio_,,icons SHOULD change
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:39:00.000Z,Cotowar,,how would i make it point to the new location? just make the pixmaps folder a shortcut to my new sets folder?
60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:40:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"fabio, how do i make the /usr/share/pixmaps point to the new icon set?"

60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:42:00.000Z,Cotowar,,how do i do it though?

60,454.tsv,2009-02-19T22:45:00.000Z,Cotowar,,"im bad at this, you're saying go to terminal, cd to my pixmaps, then do ln -s new_icon_folder_name?"

60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:41:00.000Z,Jacruth2,,Hi there
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:41:00.000Z,Jacruth2,,How could I ask for help?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:42:00.000Z,Jacruth2,,"Hi there, How could I secure delete my hard disk in GTK mode?"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:43:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,srm
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:43:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,sfill ...
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:43:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,Sfill doesnt show anything at the terminal
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:44:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,sfill -v does ;)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:44:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,-v .. and you get a * every now and then .. and when you got 32 * its almost finished
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:44:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,32? why 32?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,but depending on teh size of the size of the drive ;) its going to take a small eternity :)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,32 is the normal amount of passes it does .)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,there are options for less passes
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"I know that it could take too much time, but it's the only way to do it xD"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,... selling the drive?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"to clean the free space, I should do 'sudo sfill -I'?"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,erasing some... king of information xD
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,ok it was 38 not 32
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:47:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,-i? .. dont think theres a -i .. let me check
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:47:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,ah sorry .. yes theres a -I ;9
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:47:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,what is the difference between Inodes and space?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:49:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,it basically tells where a file is on a harddrive
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:49:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,wha is the difference between wiping inodes and wiping space? Is it not the same?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:49:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,"well .. space is where the files are stored .. ionode is where the stuff like 'date', 'owner' etc. is stored"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"then, I should erase both of them"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,ionodes doesnt contain filenames
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,if you just wipe the space .. and not the ionodes .. all any intruder knows is when a file was accessed ... but not which oen ;)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:51:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,and what about wiping the inodes and not the space? XD
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:52:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,im not saying you shouldnt do both :) just what can happen if you only do teh space
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:53:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"I know, but you said about wiping space and not inodes. What could happens If I wipe inodes and not space?"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:53:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,well .. they can see the filenames .. teh contents of the files. . but not whos the owner of the files (f its a server with severl users) or when they were created/accessed
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:54:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:54:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"so, for a deep clean, I should do both, not?"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:54:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,well .. since the ionodes are gone .. you cant access teh files on a normal system ;) .. but there are tools for reading raw data from harddrives ;)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:55:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,yes
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:55:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,now I undestand it!!!!!!!! You has great explained it!
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:55:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,but look up that shredder program mentioned
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,i think DOJ says a couple of passes iss sufficient
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"shredder only wipe 'files', not free space i think"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,ok... well tehre probably are other programs too ..
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,I look for other programs and there are not :S
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,anyway .. 38 passes is a bit more than DOJ recommends ;) .. so if youre in a hurry .. look for thoose that just goes barely over DOJ
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:57:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"thanks (do you know if there is a graphical program, anyway?)"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:58:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,only for win32
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:59:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,I could wipe Linux's space from Windows?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T00:59:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode read it just to make sure i remembered wrong
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:00:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,"since youre not savinganything on the harddrive ,) just delete the paritions .. create a ntfs if the iwnodws program required that :P and wipe it .. as long as its the same 'amount of space' it gets overwritten"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:00:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,that is a good idea
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:01:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,just dont do it from dos ;)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:02:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"i tried 'sudo sfill -v'. I thought that it could remove inode and sspace, both"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:02:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,for a normal format that is :) and a wipe/shred takes longer than taht ;)
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:02:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"however, I did too 'sudo sfill -i'"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:02:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,and it doesnt work
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:03:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,ive only used srm ;) .. but ill look it up
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:03:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"thanks you, jastor"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:04:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,you did sudo sfill -i /whatever right?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:04:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"i didnt, thanks, i forgot to specify the main folder"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:05:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,do you think I could do 'sfill -i -I' both?
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:05:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,now that ive read abit of sfill and srm .. i would do it from windwos isntead :P
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:05:00.000Z,Jacruth2,jastor,"why, Jastor?"
60,88.tsv,2010-03-14T01:06:00.000Z,jastor,Jacruth2,just seems ... like the programs for win32 has better options :P

60,451.tsv,2007-01-07T07:54:00.000Z,mwe,gen,it means synaptic is not running

60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:07:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,using? network manager? network admin (the thing in sys -> adm -> net)? command line?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:07:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,the network manager doesnt work
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:07:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,are you using WEP? ive never gotten NM to do WEP with ipw or iwl
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:07:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,I'm using WEP
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:08:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"let me try again, so i'll be back"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:08:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,try connecting from network-admin and then running 'sudo dhclient' in the terminal
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:08:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,thats the only way i can get ipw or iwl to do wep
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:08:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,what does dhclient do?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:09:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,asks the router for an IP address
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:28:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,dhlcient didnt work
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:29:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco, heres the output of dhclient: http://pastebin.com/m24ab6500
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:29:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,pm me the output of iwconfig
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,I dont have that
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,yes you do
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"but i did connect to the wireless AP, but I had a 0% connection  strength"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,"so there's 0% strength when you see the router, and the router doesn't respond when you talk to it?"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,that sounds like the router
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,I would have to restart my computer and log into ubuntu to get iwconfig
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,did you just dhclient from windows?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"no, i logged into ubuntu and dhcliented"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"but since i dont have internet on ubuntu, i have to log into windows"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,there's no wired internet around?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,it would be difficult
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"but if there is something i can do while wired to fix wireless, then i can get wired for a few"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,ok well here's what i do when i have to do wireless
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:33:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,sudo iwlist scan
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:33:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,then thatll show all available networks and you can see what your wireless card is called.  mine's wlan0
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:33:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,it used to be eth1 in gutsy though
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:34:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,then: sudo iwconfig essid 'mywirelessnetwork' key 'ABCDEF12345'
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:34:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,so that 'mywirelessnetwork' matches whatever your router is called
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:34:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,and the ABCD... thing is where your WEP key goes
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:34:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,then run 'sudo dhclient wlan0'
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T02:59:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,it didnt work
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:00:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,heres all the info i think is relevent: http://pastebin.com/m27c578ea
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:01:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,in what order did you do those? and does the access point even show up when you do 'sudo iwlist scan'?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:02:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"the AP does show up, and I did those in the order they are written down"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:03:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"i also did the iwconfig essid thing, and it didnt work"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:04:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,is this your access point? 2WIRE882
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:04:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,yes
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:05:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,"when you look with network manager, does your access point show up? is it visible?"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:06:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"yes it is, but when i try to connect to it anyway i try, it never works, even though it did in hardy, I believe it's because the wireless driver changed from ipw3945 to iwl3945"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:06:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,it worked in gutsy*
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:07:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,"well you should be able to 'sudo modprobe -r iwl3945' (might have to do it on the other things that show up when you 'lsmod | grep 3945' first because of dependencies, then 'sudo modprobe ipw3945'"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:07:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,and that might work
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:08:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,im confused by people having issues with iwl3945....it makes me want to try out my laptop on their network
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:08:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"i tried to modprobe ipw3945 already, and it said it doesnt exist, as it is no longer shipped with 8.XX and above"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:08:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,compile it?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:13:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,So what do you think could work?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:17:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,no suggestions?
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T03:17:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,maybe able to compile the ipw driver for it but :-/ your computer scares me
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T07:23:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,"hey, you there?"
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T07:23:00.000Z,maco,j_humphrey,whatss up
60,231.tsv,2008-04-25T07:23:00.000Z,j_humphrey,maco,So i think that the iwl3945 driver and my router are incompatible

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:20:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,did you use the proxy tools ? where you can actually point the machine at a proxy ?
60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:20:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,for browsers you may have to set the individually in the browser config

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:22:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,do you have a windows or 'company' machine on the same network

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:25:00.000Z,prasenjeetp,ikonia,its on my own office (i have full control over it)

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:26:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,so what is not working ?
60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:26:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,as it should do.

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:27:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,what is not working for you
60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:28:00.000Z,prasenjeetp,ikonia,example : if i use uploadify (or any other flash based code) or if i just want to use PHP's fopen for a URL

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T12:30:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,it depends how far you want to go and what you really want to do.

60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T20:29:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,then they should be using tools such as mysql's database tools
60,24.tsv,2011-09-21T20:30:00.000Z,ikonia,prasenjeetp,or depending on their systems administrators to manage things like the configs

60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:56:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,ah I see
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:57:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,i get the same error with: sudo grub-install /dev/hda - which is - /dev/mapper/casper-snapshot does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:58:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,partitions have there own special version of the mbr
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:58:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,so what do I do?
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:59:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,whats in the /etc/grub.conf  file
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:59:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,BTW I'm in a live CD if that makes any difference
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T05:59:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,there is no such file
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:00:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,aaah yeah it wont work
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:00:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,how do I get grub going again then?
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:00:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,you dont with a live disk
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:01:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,how do I then?
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:01:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,the cd becomes the primary master when you boot of it

60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:02:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,you just need to mount the partition then burn/save the files to another media
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:02:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,"cool, how do I do so?"
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:02:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,you dont need grub for that
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:02:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,i tried mounting /dev/hda1 but it didn't work
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:02:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,so windows is on hda1 right
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:03:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,windows is on hda2
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:03:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,ok is it ntfs
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:03:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,"don't think so, but really sure though"
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:03:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,"don't think so, but not really sure though"
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:04:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,normaly you just creat a directory with ie mkdir /windows   then mount ti with  mount -t vfat /dev/hda2  /windows
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:05:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,if it doesnt work then its ntfs
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:05:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,the critical files I need are on the linux partition
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:05:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,then just mount the Linux partition
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:06:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd, mkdir  /linux   mount -t ext2 /dev/whatever  /linux
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:07:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,thanks! :))
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:07:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,"but is there a way so I don't have to restart, ie. get grub running?"
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:12:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,"so your basically trying to reinstall grub from a Live cd, yeah your problem is you trying to install the CD's version of grub not the one on the hardisk"
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:12:00.000Z,linux_galor1,jksd,you need to mount the hardisk
60,382.tsv,2006-05-14T06:14:00.000Z,jksd,linux_galor1,"ahh, gotcha"

60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:29:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"you mean how to mount it, or how to put it inside the box"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:30:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,mount it and format ect
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:30:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,ok well do 'sudo fdisk -l' and see if it is in the output and what it is called and whatnot
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:32:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,I sent you a pm
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:32:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"yeah didn't get it, but in any sense, we can do this in here"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:32:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,alright. its called : /dev/sdb
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:33:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig, fdisk says : /dev/sdb doesnt contain a valid partition table
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:33:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok, do you have gparted?"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:33:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,"its a clean install so I guess not, should I grab it ?"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:33:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,yeah sudo apt-get install gparted (after the install it will be listed as gnome partition editor)
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:35:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok install and started
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:35:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok make sure sdb is selected at the top right and then right click and create to format, what did you want to format it as, ext3 or fat32 or what"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:36:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok selected. just as some linux filesys.. I guess ext3. Its going to be used as a large file storage
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:36:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok if just for linux then ext3, when you get all that done and apply the changes, tell me"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:37:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok one thing. asks me for disk label? just select msdos? or advanced?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:38:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"hmmm, not sure, I am thinking advanced but someone else might know better"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:38:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"I am sure it doesn't matter, both will probably work, I don't know the difference though"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:40:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,I chose msdos. other selections made no sence. Should I create as a primary partition or extended?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:40:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,primary
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:41:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok done. should I format it now then?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:41:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,yeah
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:42:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,"ok its now formatting, its a pretty large drive so this may take some time. May I contact you for further instructions when its done?"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:42:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,yeah I will be here
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:43:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,great thanks
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,its now formatted. but somehow almost 8gb is used on the drive after format. how is that possible?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,are you sure that isn't just a difference between kilobyte and kibibyte
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:47:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"but anyways, I am assuming you want this to mount at boot?"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:48:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,"shouldnt be the difference: its a 500gb hd. listed at 465gb, used: 7.51gb unused: 458,25. And yes mount at boot :D"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:49:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok, well make the directory that you are going to mount it in by doing 'sudo mkdir /media/sdb1' (I assume it made a partition called sdb1)"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:50:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,done.
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:50:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok did you want to have standard permissions throughout the drive, like have everyone be able to read and write to it, or did you want to make the permissions as you go"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:52:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,not sure. everyone from network over smb should be able to read/write but my ftp users should have different rights to some folders ect...
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:53:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok, well edit the /etc/fstab file by putting this line in it: /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1 ext3 defaults 0 0"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:53:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,you can set up the permissions as you go that way
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:55:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,the only user will be me on local. Should I type the 'defaults' just after a tab right after ext3?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:55:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,yeah make sure there is whitespace in between each of those things
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:55:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,alright done.
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:56:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"yeah so should mount at boot, do 'sudo mount -a' to mount it now"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:56:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,done. seems like its mounted :D
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:57:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,anything else I need to know?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:57:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,no
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:57:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,alright Thanks alot for your help.
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:57:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"might have to chmod it to your specifications at some point is all, if you get permission denied or something"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:58:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,chmod the whole drive or you mean the folders I create inside?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T07:59:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"the folders you create inside, or you might need to chmod the mount point"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:00:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"if you had some certain permission setup you wanted throughout the drive, that can be setup in the fstab. But if you have different permissions you want on different files, then you would have to set those up as you go"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:02:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,alright. I will return here if I run into problems with it. Whats the package called for telnet server and is there some way to remote desktop the machine from a winxp machine?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:03:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"not sure about the second one, I am sure there is a way, someone else here probably knows"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:05:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok so sudo apt-get install inetutils-telnetd ?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:06:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,yeah it is in the universe repository though so make sure you have that enabled. you can enable that by doing 'sudo sed -i 's/# deb/deb/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update'
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:07:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,"yep, I added all the reps from the package manager already."
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:07:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"ok good, then yeah"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:12:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok its installed. Any idea on how to start it? Seems like it doesnt run automatically?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:13:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,it appears to be in /usr/sbin/telnetd
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:13:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,so you could presumably do 'telnetd' or type that full path
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:13:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"might have to sudo telnetd, not sure on the permissions"
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:14:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,man telnetd should give you other information too
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:15:00.000Z,dk1447,bruenig,ok seems like its started. But I cannot connect to it via securecrt on port 22. did I do something wrong?
60,301.tsv,2007-03-25T08:16:00.000Z,bruenig,dk1447,"I don't know much on the specifics of telnet, you can do 'man telnetd' to see  what it says. But I don't know"

60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:01:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,no file there.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:02:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, is this the awesome that you compiled on top of the Ubuntu repository Awesome pkg?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:02:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,this is just the package.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:03:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, Your rc.lua is in ~/.config/awesome/   right?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:03:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,yup.  and awesome -k says the syntax is OK.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:04:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, What makes you think that it's not running rc.lua ?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:05:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I changed the label 'debian' to 'apps' on the menu and restarted awesome.  The menu text didn't change.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:06:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris,Could you pastebin that section.... maybe I could spot something wrong with it?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:10:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,http://pastebin.com/ZN4AKMTT I think it is in order.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:13:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," super-silly question, but did you reload awesome?"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:14:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,Yup.  And have rebooted a few times since making changes elsewhere (adding Delightful widgets).
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:19:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," I just tried it. In rc.lua go to the bit where it says 'table.insert(menu_items, { 'awesome', my ............' that's where you have to add/change the debian menu item"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:23:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"hm, so your rc.lua seems to look a lot different from mine.  Did you use the ubuntu package too?"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:26:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," ooops, sorry. That bit is not part of the default config, I'll look into this some more"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:30:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," Hmm yeah, can'tn see anything wrong. Did you try starting awesome with '-c' and pointing to the rc.lua? Otherwise you should try asking at #awesome on the OFTC IRC"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:31:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"I use a display manager, it's a session, I don't call it myself.  And I'm pretty sure if I killed X it would restart."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:31:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,can I restart it with added args somehow?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:32:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris,which display manager?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:33:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"The one that ships with ubuntu, I assume that's GDM still."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:33:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, sec lemme try something
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:37:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," yeh killing Awm throws you out of X :P Just to make sure it's using ~/rc.lua , can you make a change to that becomes visible?"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:42:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"well, I successfully killed X, but I still can't call awesome.  It can't open the display."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:42:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, Is that a new problem? Awesome won't start now?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:45:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"well, it's supposed to start by lightdm, so I'm going to reboot to get it up again.  But the thing is, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is empty, and referred to in the awesome man, so I wonder if that's the problem."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:46:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, That's a really good idea. Define that var in /etc/profile
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:47:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, define AND export
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:48:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, and then reboot and it should be defined globally
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T00:53:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"Just made those changes, I'll reboot now"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:02:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"my awesome came back up after the reboot... with nothing different at all.  And I remembered to export that variable, it's visible from my term."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:05:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," Check msg ^^ . Also, can yo umake a visible change in ~/rc.lua and reload to see if that rc.lua is the one that's used or not?"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:05:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,the menu change and delightful widgets would have popped up.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:06:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, so it seems that it's using /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua instead?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:07:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I feel like making a visible change to /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua to test that theory.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:09:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,It indeed is still loading the global one.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:11:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, I've had a thought. Check `ps -elf | grep awesome` and see what user runs it? maybe root?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:13:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I think it'll just be easier to change the global file.  Noone else uses this system.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:14:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," I was gonna suggest that, but check if you have an stderr / stdout file like I do in ~/.cache/awesome"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:15:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, see you are missing those and the rest of the files in directories ~/.config/awesome and ~/.cache/awesome
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:16:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"Well, that broke it.  But the syntax is fine."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:17:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, what broke?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:19:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," I'm really curious, could you check which user owns process awesome? root?"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:22:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,dmorris  13832  0.1  0.2 158552  8772 ?        Ss   17:19   0:00 awesome
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:22:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"I think it knows it would fail, and so loads the global one -- I had to use the unity wm to fix that."
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:23:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, I agree. Whenever I loaded a broken rc.lua it used the default one. Probably those delicious widgets :P
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:24:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I'll try commenting out those widgets then adding them one by one if it loads.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:26:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," Btw so you get dirs like ~/.cache/awesome , here is a list of my XDG vars that were there automatically since yours seem to be missing. Maybe you can adapt them: http://pastebin.com/ddPaiwr3"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:30:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I'm gonna also undo the change to my /etc/profile... that's sure to mess something up.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:30:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris, They point to the right place? What would they mess up?
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:31:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,I guess I'm just being superstitious.
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:32:00.000Z,NewWorld,davidrsmorris," I think logically, if anything else after /etc/profile want to set that var it will just supersede it"
60,10.tsv,2012-08-05T01:34:00.000Z,davidrsmorris,NewWorld,"yup, and it looks like it was my delightful widgets.  Thanks, I'll be looking through those very carefully."

60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:02:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,you might be able to work up some weird solution.  im sure it's possible somehow using .bin files from grub or smoething.  but i wouldnt be able to describe the procedue
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:03:00.000Z,Aemo,xtknight,"that method is recommended for the linux noob, is it?"

60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:12:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,not sure
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:13:00.000Z,Aemo,xtknight,"by using that command, does it clean it for you, or do you have to run it afterwards"
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:13:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,hm i think you have to run it whenever you want to clean cache.  cache is persistent until then
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z,Aemo,xtknight,is it suppose to show up under applications?
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,what is supposed to show under Applications?
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:15:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,no that isnt under Applications.  it's 'sudo apt-get autoclean'
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T09:16:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,'autoclean is like install.  it's a command.  you dont install autoclean'

60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T10:00:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,update just updates apt's database.  'upgrade' is what actually updates all the packages
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T10:01:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,it was necessary if there was updates.
60,298.tsv,2007-04-13T10:01:00.000Z,xtknight,Aemo,it does 'apt-get update' periodically automatically if that's what you mean

60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:38:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,look at the initbottom script (or marker in the main script)
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:38:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,do you know where it is?
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:38:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,/boot/scripts?

60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:39:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,/boot/scripts ??? that doesn't even exist
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:39:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,that was just a wild guess since i thought it only had /boot mounted (maybe just through grub you know)
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:39:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,just a wild guess
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:40:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,stupid me sorry
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone, /boot onlt contains the kernel
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:40:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,and initrd and stuff System map etc.
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,that's the kernel stuff
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:42:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,TRUE
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:43:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,/etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom is empty :-(
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:44:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,"ok, so look at what's next in the sequnnce"
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:44:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,"although thats init-ramfs , are you sure htat's what it's executing"
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:45:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,because during the upgrade /boot grew too large (100%)

60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:59:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,what is the exact command you are using ?
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T01:59:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,service mysql start

60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:01:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,why ?
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:02:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,because my system hangs after init-bottom
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:02:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,i need to dump my db and resetup the system
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:03:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,what is the exact error when you try to start it
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:03:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,it prints simply nothing
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:04:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,"ok, so if you just want to dump the db, start mysqld manually, connect to it and dump it"
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:04:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,when i run init 2  i am getting init: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:04:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,yes because the init process is not running
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:05:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,basically it is simple i need to make my service available again
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:05:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,and yes all i want to do is simply start the db in the same way upstart does this
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:06:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,just start mysqld manually and take a dump/export
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:06:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,before upstart and with sysv scripts you would simply run /etc/init.d/mysql start
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:06:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,you can't do that now
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:06:00.000Z,milestone,ikonia,i know but there is an /etc/init/mysql.conf
60,386.tsv,2012-11-13T02:06:00.000Z,ikonia,milestone,what's that got to do with anything ?

60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:30:00.000Z,derklempner,Tashia,you need to set up your wireless adapter by configuring /etc/network/interfaces to connect to a network.
60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:30:00.000Z,Tashia,derklempner,Any tutorials on setting that up?

60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:33:00.000Z,derklempner,Tashia,but make sure you know the name of your wireless adapter by running the ifconfig command before you edit that file.  Your adapter may not be named 'wlan0'.

60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:36:00.000Z,derklempner,Tashia,how many adapters and what are their names show up when you type the command ifconfig?
60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:36:00.000Z,derklempner,Tashia,how about if you type the command iwconfig?
60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:37:00.000Z,derklempner,Tashia,then I think your wireless device isn't being recognized.  Do you know what brand it is?  Is it USB or a PCI card?
60,64.tsv,2011-01-24T09:38:00.000Z,Tashia,derklempner,internal if that helps

60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:20:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,there is nothing in lspci - only with an older kernel it is activated and appears in lspci and ifconfig
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:21:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,zero output from lspci?
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:21:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,oh sry i thought you want to know the network line
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:24:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,http://paste.ubuntu.com/437820/
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:25:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,ifconfig shows just lo and wlan0/ath0 ?
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:25:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,right - only on another older kernel eth0 appears
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:26:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,"this is 10.04, correct? or something earlier"
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:26:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,no it is 10.04
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:26:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,kernel 2.6.32-22-generic
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:26:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,is that using the attansic chipset by chance? I thought it was in the kernel by now
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:27:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,dont know...
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:27:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,and which kernel prior works with/shows the eth0
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:27:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,2.6.31-21-generic for example
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:28:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,and 2.6.31-10-rt works
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:28:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,and you still have those present? sounds like a definite bug/regression
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:29:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,yes everytime i want to use wired network i have to choose the kernel in grub
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:31:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,"that is exceedingly odd, sounds like a clear bug related to either installing the rt kernel alongside the generic one, or a regression in the latest generic kernel. I would file a bug report if I were you"
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:33:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,please keep it in channel
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:34:00.000Z,raven,bazhang,is thinkable that modprobe does not take effect because the module has to be loaded in another runlevel for example or during bootup? is there anything i can edit to execute anything during or before the kernel boots?
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T17:35:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,seriously doubt that
60,260.tsv,2010-05-22T18:28:00.000Z,bazhang,raven,good news

60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T13:58:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,you'd rather explain the problem you're trying to solve
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:00:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,what are you trying to achieve exactly ?

60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:03:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"i don't say i don't want to help, trying to figure out something"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:04:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"you could write a wrapper script in /usr/local/bin/ which start your update, and add this script to sudoers, so that you can execute the script as root with no password"

60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:06:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,something like this: http://pastebin.com/6xk2JqDz
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:07:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,that is a script that runs exactly what you want
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:08:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,"yes it does. I guess where I get confused it to put it in the sudoers folder and all that stuff. I really don't know what the sudoers folder is, and what it does."
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:08:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,just put the wrapper script in /usr/local/bin/ make it owned by root:root with perm 755
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:09:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,what is a wrapper script? is it different from a regular script?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:09:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,then use visudo to edit sudoers file and add a line like: %steffen ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/amarok
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:09:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"no, it just wrap the exact command(s) you want to run as root"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:10:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,then use visudo to edit sudoers file and add a line like: %Friar ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/wrapper-update.sh
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:11:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,also be very careful with owner and permission on the wrapper script
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:12:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,just make sure that I'm the owner of the script and have permission to execute it?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:12:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,NOOOOOOO
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:12:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,you must not be the owner at all cost
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:13:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"like i said earlier the script has to be owned by root:root, and permission 755"

60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:34:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,show me ls -l /usr/local/bin/<your script>

60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:34:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"aaah ok, so problem solved ? :)"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:35:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"just to be sure, could you show permission on the script file ?"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:36:00.000Z,Friar,lestat, -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  155 2010-10-10 11:20 update.sh*
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:36:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,ok perfect :)
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:37:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,is /usr/local/bin the place where you can put any script and run it without having to add the absolute path? just in general though....
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:37:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"/usr/local/bin/ is usually included in PATH, it's the recommended place to add custom script etc"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:38:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,great...can I edit PATH? to include ~/bin? where is PATH defined?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:38:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,also check every other command you run with sudo requires a password
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:38:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,it's no a good idea
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:39:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,changing PATH is not a good idea? or making a ~/bin directory?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:40:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"chaning PATH is ok, as long as the path you add is only writable by root. The bad thing is to add folders owned by yourself"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:41:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"exactly, otherwise it's so easy for someone with your account to replace your bins with trojan code"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:42:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,i'm starting to see the bigger picture here. Thanks a lot for your time and explanations. I really appreciate it.
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:42:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,i think you could also give those permissions: 711
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:43:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,"so they can't even read it, just execute. perfect."
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:43:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"not 100% sure it would work though, but 90% sure :P"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:44:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,great. thanks. I did check other commands to make sure that they require me to enter my password and they do. Thank You.
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:44:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"also, if you use that 'technique' for other stuff, be very careful what command you allow"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:44:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"for example if you were to allow to run vim as root with no passwd, it's so easy to get a root shell from there"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:45:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,I don't think I'll be using that again. unless I reinstall and I want to do it again....what is vim?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:45:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"a text editor, from which you can exec command"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:46:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"so for example if you allow to start vim as root with no password, i can exec /bin/bash from there, and the spawned shell will be a root shell"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:46:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,I see. so if root opens up vim then he/she could run just about any command from vim as root?
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:47:00.000Z,lestat,Friar,"not only root, but any user allowed to run your wrapper script"
60,352.tsv,2010-10-10T14:48:00.000Z,Friar,lestat,thanks. I see where this is going...be very careful about using this 'technique' with other things cause it could easily cause problems.

60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:22:00.000Z,desnaike,,i looked at pastebin

60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:23:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,"it's probably not the driver's fault, i'm suspecting it can't read the EDID cuz the monitor is VGA and the graphics card outputs HDMI, and i'm connecting it through an adapter"
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:23:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,most probably the adapter messes up the EDID stuff
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:23:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,driver is 185 btw
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:24:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,"but tried older version and got the same result, also windows couldn't read the EDID either, but windows still has my resolution in the list :("

60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:31:00.000Z,desnaike,RandomizeR,what i found on google suggest the adapter and repo drivers not being as good
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:32:00.000Z,desnaike,RandomizeR,fixes were to do manual install with drivers from nvidia site hope it works
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:32:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,"well, right now i'd be happy if i could just set the resolution manually"
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:33:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,"i think it would work with a DVI monitor, the problem is that my LCD is connected through a DVI-to-VGA adapter"

60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:34:00.000Z,desnaike,RandomizeR,i agree from what i've googled it's the adapter
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:34:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,but i can't even find my monitor's edid.bin anywhere online (ViewSonic VA712)
60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T05:36:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,so all i'm hoping to do now as a last resort is to tell it to ignore the EDID and just set the resolution manually

60,132.tsv,2010-01-29T06:24:00.000Z,RandomizeR,desnaike,i plugged the monitor to my old PC and scanned the EDID from there

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:53:00.000Z,jneves,alp,let's just say that the linux version is less optimized than it should be

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:53:00.000Z,alp,jneves,how can I interpret results of iostat

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:54:00.000Z,alp,jneves,is that flash blocker a firefox plugin (btw here is the result: http://paste.ubuntu.com/484991/)

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:56:00.000Z,jneves,alp,and check the differences
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:57:00.000Z,alp,jneves,Blk_read is 0 but Blk_wrt/s always >40. there is a Blk_wrtn (I do not know what is that) tps is relatively small about 1
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T19:58:00.000Z,jneves,alp,that means something is writing a lot - run free and paste the result

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:00:00.000Z,jneves,alp,"but it's not swap doing the writing, so you must have some application constantly writing to disk at the moment - try to find out which"

60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:20:00.000Z,jneves,alp,do you now how to edit a grub line?
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:22:00.000Z,alp,jneves,well obviously we cant solve that :) but I have a question. look at the output from powertop: http://paste.ubuntu.com/485009/ do you have such a 97.4% on you computer?
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:24:00.000Z,jneves,alp,more - that's normal - means that the cpu is most of the time on the lowest frequency - that's a good thing
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:25:00.000Z,alp,jneves,does not it mean my Core1 is running on a high freq (false positive)
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:26:00.000Z,jneves,alp,that would be if the 1.84MHz had the higher %
60,410.tsv,2010-08-28T20:26:00.000Z,jneves,alp,not the 1MHz one

60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:09:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,the big G has an address for it - careful make sure you install the x version
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:10:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,someone made me do it once
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:12:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,where can i get the program?
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:14:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,nvm found it
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:15:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,if you get stuck with it ping me -- have had to show people it a few times
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:16:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,ok thanks
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:20:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,^^ see amenado's comment
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:45:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,"i installed it. when i run the command i get a window with that X cursor, and with a crosspatern (with is hard to look at)"
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:46:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,you need to make your server talk xdmcp
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:46:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,it does (or it should be)
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:47:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,that is an indication that it is not - just an X mid screen
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:47:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,dithered gray? yea
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:48:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,ok your xdm is not broadcasting
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:49:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,do i have to restart X/gdm to get it to start broadcasting?
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:50:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,can't remember
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:50:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,I'll restart X here to find out
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:51:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,eh it's ok i'll just try it
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:51:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,having issues with the hardy heron ...
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T18:57:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,nope.
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:15:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,"ok - for restricted drivers a restart in full needed, for xdmcp then gdm/kdm/xdm needs to be restarted, resolution changes can be done in different ways but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial ;-) my preferred method being sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:15:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,"i restarted the comp and it's now responding to XDCMP, but it won't login"
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:15:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,think username password for that box and are the languages the same
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:16:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,or locale
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:16:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,suggest you test with a test user and a simpler password
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:16:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,i don't get a login screen
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:16:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,i think i know the problem though. one moment
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:17:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,what are you getting?
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:17:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,know that the screen with X and the 'bad grey' background comes from the local server on cygwin
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:19:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,works. i had to switch the remote mode from 'Same as local' to 'Plain with face browser'. (it's a bug)
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:20:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,hmm I don't have that issue with any of my boxes (running iit on a few different versions)
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:21:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,i think it's a bug on gutsy
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:22:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,let me check
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:23:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,I am running same as local here
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:24:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,maybe you changed something else at the same time
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:27:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,this thing is not working very good.
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:28:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,"hmm, it should be flying if they are on the same lan"
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:28:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,it's like i'm running a beta or alpha or something
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:28:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,of cygwin?
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:29:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,i assume it's cygwin and not the comp i'm not connecting to
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:32:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,"perhaps I am happy enough with the way it is here - on that other platform you don't do some of the stuff you would do in a native situation, for instance X -query boxrunningxdmcp on a native platform is sudo X :1 -query boxrunningxdmcp ..  there 1 is a viewing terminal ctrl alt F7 / 8 / 9 depending on how you are set up"
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:41:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,the fix was?
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:43:00.000Z,Ashfire908,ompaul,none really. i restarted but only because the thing caused gdm to not be able to log anyone in
60,303.tsv,2008-03-22T19:43:00.000Z,ompaul,Ashfire908,ack
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:03:00.000Z,smalleyes,,what's the BEST/Official way to install skype?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:03:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,i'm pretty sure there's a .deb for skype
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:03:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,"yes i know, but is that the best way?"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:04:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,install from .deb; yes
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:04:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,not from repo?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:04:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,installing from deb adds the software to the application installed cache
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:04:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,its a matter of personal preference really
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:05:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,depends on how much you trust the software provider
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:05:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"now, i take the stand that, if i like their software, i'll trust their work, so i like to use cutting edge SVN a lot for my favorites"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:06:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"but, again, it's a matter of preference, and comparing what version 8.10 offers for example compared to the version on skypes website"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:07:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"it's likely that ubuntu won't release a significant version change until 9.04, so if you want the latest and greatest you often have to go towards the source"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:07:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,latest and greatest of what?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:07:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,this is most often the case immediately before a new release
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:07:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,of what?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:07:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"new features, bugfixes, etc..."
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:08:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,i'm lost
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:08:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"let's stand back and look at the big picture then; you've got the Main branch developers, then you've got the MOTU (masters of the universe)"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:08:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,then you've got everybody else
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:08:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,i was asking about skype
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:09:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,but you can't make up your mind over whether or not to install from repo or the website
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:09:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,right?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:09:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,because i wanted to know the difference
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:10:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,***
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:11:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"think of it like, 'there's a middle man corporation muddling the whole process up'"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:12:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"they're careful, and they've got my best interests at heart, but they just don't have enough manpower because they're a non-profit charity"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:12:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,and a few middlemen are responsible for ensuring that literally thousands of packages are upgraded per version release
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:13:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"now, what you don't know is that all the sofware in the repos for 8.10, the stuff in universe and multiverse like skype, ended up there probably 2 or 3 months ago"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:13:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"so even though 8.10 is new, the software is a little behind"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:14:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"further, the motu guys i mentioned, are off working on the next version of ubuntu, and those upgrades"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:14:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,ok.
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:15:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"so you're left with a choice, take what's very likely going to work alright, from the ubuntu repos, or take what may or may not work better, but has a higher (much higher) chance of coming out with more versions, from the skype site"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:16:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"and, if you don't like it get rid of it, switch your software sources, and go back to the ubuntu repos"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:16:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"it's pretty easy to try one, decide you dont' like it, and go back"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:16:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,ok.
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:16:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,the whole debian repo concept is really forgiving on that
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:17:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,see above
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:17:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,just don't go doing a dist upgrade and think you can turn back the clock on that ;)
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:17:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,never mind.
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:17:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,i understand
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:20:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,try padsp
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:20:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,try padsp for skype audio problem?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:21:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"yes, with pulseaudio, works fantastic, i mean FANTASTIC for me"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:21:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,did that fix your skype problem too?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:21:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"i don't use skype, but generally, padsp will pipe any audio to /dev/dsp"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:22:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"so, if /dev/dsp works, padsp will work"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:22:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,how can I figure out if /dev/dsp works?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:24:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,how can I figure out if /dev/dsp works?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:25:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,"another question: if padsp doesn't work for me, may it make my computer worse possibly? if it does, can we undo the installation of padsp?"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:26:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"please, don't worry so much about software hurting your computer!"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:26:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,this isn't windows!
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:27:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,pls answer: how can I confirm whether /dev/dsp will work??
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:29:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,so i guess i should try padsp
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:36:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,audio seems to be a recurring problem with skype: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:37:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,that's too bad. skype worked fine for me on 8.04. but not on a clean install of ubuntu 8.10. what shall i do? install padsp??? is that the solution?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:39:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"8.04 preferred the ESD sound mixer, bit if i'm not mistaken, ubuntu prefers pulseaudio now"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:39:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,and for good reason i believe
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:39:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,ok. how can i force skype to work. 8-(
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:41:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,"i was right, section four of that link i gave you suggests that skype uses OSS"
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:41:00.000Z,rdw200169,smalleyes,have you tried running skype with 'padsp skype'?
60,177.tsv,2008-11-02T09:42:00.000Z,smalleyes,rdw200169,not yet.
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:42:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,,hello everybody!
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:42:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,,is there  a way to find out what ips are connected to your wifi connection over ubuntu?
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:43:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, you can check your client list through your router
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:43:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,how do I access that?
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:43:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, type route in your shell and connect to your gateway
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:44:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, do that in your web browser something like http://192.168.2.1 or if your router is accessible via telnet I'm not sure what router you have.
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:44:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,it's 192.168.1.1
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:44:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan," you're going to need to know your password for your router.  I hope you changed it, cuz it's not a good idea to leave your router with the default l/p."
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:45:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, go to your browser and type http://192.168.1.1
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:45:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,,did so
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:45:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, you will either be prompted for an l/p or when you try to go to administrative settings within your browser you will need to type your l/p
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:46:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, you need to find something like DHCP client list.
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:46:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,I never used a password
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:46:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, what type of router do you have?
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:47:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, hang on I'll figure it out for you.
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:47:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,,kozumi wireless
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:48:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, what did you say your router was?
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:48:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,,kozumi wireless
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:49:00.000Z,hexdump_,,okie hang on
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:50:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,"ok, thanks"
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:51:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, try l/p guest
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:52:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,cool
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:52:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, if that doesn't work try admin/admin
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:52:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,guest did the work
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:52:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, were you able to get into your router now?

60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:53:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, now I know nothing about your router but see if you can find an area that says DHCP client list.
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:54:00.000Z,hexdump_,FriedrichMan, go to status and check statistics
60,87.tsv,2010-04-06T20:55:00.000Z,FriedrichMan,hexdump_,theres no ips in status7statics

60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:06:00.000Z,wolfprint,,Panel Question - thanks: Ubuntu v.7.10 Gnome.... was wondering if there is a way to do away with the handles (to move panel) other then having it 'expand' - thanks again
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:07:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I've long wished for the same thing. AFAIK there is no way. The easiest solution is to run AWN.
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:10:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix,"thanks I  thought so but figured I  would ask, yea tried all others not impress really... (well impressed but ..)"
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:13:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix, I would think that there would be a way though through some sort of manual  editing of a file for that particular panel but guess not
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:21:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I've been looking hard and editing my gconf keys to no effect.
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:22:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,It's difficult because I'm not even sure what to call it.. side of gnome panel?
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:22:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix," i know what yo mean... move handles, panel handles... heh your guess as good as mine"
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:25:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix, what file were you looking at (editing) for the panel(s)
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:29:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,,wolfprint:
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:29:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix,yes?
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:29:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,"I'm looking at this article right now: How to Change the Color of Gnome Panel Text, Handles, Buttons, and¬†More"
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:29:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I believe they are called handles.
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:29:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix, ok
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:30:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,The article links to this http://brentroos.com/2006/07/07/change-gnome-panel-text-color/ but that does not say anything about handles...
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:30:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix, on my way
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:34:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I think the file you want is found in your usr theme folder. Do 'locate gtkrc' and then 'gksudo gedit /usr/share/themes' followed by the actual theme name and full path of the gtk-rc file
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:35:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix,find anything on that site - taking to long to load on my end (closed it) - but I was reading elsewhere and appears that its an annoance that can not be over-riden
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:37:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I dunno... I'm finding some stuff... bear with me
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:40:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,I found this setting in my gtk-rc file
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:40:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,GtkPaned       ::handle-size          = 6
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:41:00.000Z,wolfprint,,well before you start changing anything  BACKUP
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:41:00.000Z,ArthurArchnix,wolfprint,"Changing it to 0, 1 , 10 had no effect. But I'm going to try changing a different gtk-rc file in case my present them just references a general one."
60,251.tsv,2007-11-17T21:43:00.000Z,wolfprint,ArthurArchnix," I dont think its that easy but good luck and thanks for the help I need to go AFK for a bit, check this out u see why http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-376120.html that sorta of telling it can not be doen"
